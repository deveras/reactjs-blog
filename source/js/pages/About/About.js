          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I grew up during a time when doing silly things outside with your
            mates was a thing. However, it didn't take long until the wonders of
            technology seduced and drove me inside, thus transforming an
            extrovert into a moderate introvert. This passion for technology is
            a strong personal trait, one that led me to embarked in a European
            professional life experience that shaped the person I am today.

            Hi! I'm André, a trust wordy problem solver that adapts with ease
            without topping a strong sense of responsibility. After dodging some
            curve balls and climbing steep hills, I was lucky to find myself at
            the top of Maslow's pyramid. Knowing where I was, I couldn't stop
            myself. My phycological multipotentiality in tandem with my Einstein
            like passionate curiosity, drove me from taking a Cyber Security
            Masters from Northumbria University to attempting an MBA at{' '}
            <span lang="pt-PT">Universidade de Coimbra</span>. During these
            endeavours and despite a short-term memory of only a few gigabytes,
            I managed to achieve things I never thought I would. Nonetheless,
            this recent academic facet drove me away from the keyboard, the
            place where hours fly without warning. This cursed blessing, only
            really hurts when you lift your eyes and have a look around, but its
            again time to forget time and have some fun. I hope you enjoy the
            blog.

            Professionally, I've performed in many roles with different levels
            of responsibility, in many market verticals. I've worked in small
            little shops of 2 programmers and in multi-cultural internationally
            renowned web companies with hundreds, enjoying them all. I've played
            with a lot of different technologies and shared professional
            experiences with a lot of smart people from different parts of the
            world while based in Portugal, Ireland, Spain and England. I’ve
            travelled to closer and distant countries like Mexico and the US to
            support customers and colleagues alike. I've experienced developing
            applications for: Smart TVs, PlayStation, Nintendo, X-Box, Roku,
            mobiles and desktops alike. I've done backend, I’ve done frontend,
            I've used waterfall, Agile and Kanban, but time flies when I'm
            programming.

            Outside of the office, I enjoy wine tasting, repeating good meals,
            watching games, driving around and cycling. Love playing Sid Meier's
            Civilization VI at the moment. I speak a few languages and I'm
            always eager to engage in conversation using any of them. I'm fluent
            in English, Portuguese and French. I can also speak Spanish and
            understand Italian, perhaps less common is the fact that I can
            manage a tiny bit of Polish and a bit less Lithuanian, not
            conversational but enough to get around (whenever I get to visit).
            At a certain point in time I knew basic Irish sign language, but
            I've forgot it now. I've also tried Chinese, but my ears couldn't
            quite make out the difference between the sounds (I still find
            'Portuguese people' hilarious <span lang="ce">(葡萄牙人)</span>).
            Now a days renovating my grandparents' house in a frugal DIY fashion
            to the extent that I can, but I can already share some stories and
            show some remarkable progress for someone that didn't have a clue
            what he was doing in the beginning (it's great to have friends and
            the Internet).

          <h1>My Cyber Security disertation abstract</h1>
          <h2>
            An event-driven simulation on VANETs security using physical layer
            security of wireless communications
          </h2>
          <p>
            Vehicles exchanging information between themselves and road side
            units supported by IEEE 802.11p will soon allow mankind to produce
            new solutions to tackle traffic problems that have existed for
            decades. To ensure and enable that Ad Hoc wireless communications
            are secure, the dissertation presented a software artefact capable
            of simulating their interactions when attempting to produce a
            symmetric based private key with IEEE 802.11p physical layer
            properties of wireless communication, additive white gaussian noise,
            scatterers mobility and turbo codes for information reconciliation.
            Supported on international standards best practices allied with an
            Agile development methodology, the produced simulator allows for
            further exploration of the most suitable settings to apply in
            different traffic scenarios.
